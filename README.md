# Technologies Used

# HTML/CSS: HTML is used for structuring the web pages, while CSS is used for styling and layout.

# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): AJAX is used to send and receive data from the server without reloading the entire page. It is essential for real-time messaging.

# Django Channels: Django Channels is an extension to Django that enables handling asynchronous protocols like WebSockets. It's used for real-time communication.
